6. @Configuration
7. multiple application properities
8. what is garbage collection
9. when garbage collection can we forcefully ? -> No we cannot forcefully garbage collect
10. what is finalize method -> used for clean up activities

12 Stringbuilder is not thread safe


###

1. String vs StringBuffer
2. Thread Mehtods talk with each other->wait,notify,notifyAll
3. what are starter dependencies in springboot
4. how do you connect database to connect to database -> configuration of database paramaters like url,username & password
5. Changes in Internal working of Hashmap in java 8 -> before java 8 linked list to store the data => java 8 it changed to red black tree.
6. Changes in java 8 in garbage collection ->
7. Default methods in java 8.
8. why optional class is introduced in java8.
9. Latest version of spring 3 how it is different from spring 2. -> supports java latest versions and supports cloud and microservices.
10. How many types of scopes are there is spring. 5 types
11. Design patterns -> Singleton- it ensures only one instance for database connectivity, Factory
12. Solid principles-> s-class should have a single responsibilty o-classes should be open for extension and closed for modification.
13.                     l-> Objects of superclass should be replacable by objects subclass. i-> interface aggregation d-> dependency injection
